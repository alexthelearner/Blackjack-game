# Blackjack-game
Hi There

This is a simple blackjack game coded using only basic features of the standard library. Range and Standard in/out are the only pre made parts. I am a beginer and like solving these sorts of puzzles. To optimise the game I recomend you adjust the size of your console or comand prompt window so that the result of the previous game is the first thing you read at the top of the window.
